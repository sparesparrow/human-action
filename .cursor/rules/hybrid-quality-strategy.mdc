# Hybrid Quality Strategy Rule

This rule establishes a strategic approach for balancing audio quality and cost by using both ElevenLabs and Espeak engines for different parts of the content.

## Strategy Overview

The hybrid approach:
1. Uses high-quality ElevenLabs API for critical content sections
2. Uses free Espeak engine for standard narrative sections
3. Combines both outputs into seamless chapter audio files

## Quality Allocation Guidelines

### ElevenLabs Priority Content (High Quality)

Allocate to ElevenLabs when the content:
- Introduces key concepts or chapter themes (introductions)
- Explains critical definitions or technical terms
- Contains important quotations or dialogue
- Presents crucial arguments or conclusions (summaries)
- Requires emotional nuance or varied intonation
- Contains complex Czech pronunciation challenges

### Espeak Standard Content (Cost-Effective)

Allocate to Espeak when the content:
- Provides standard narrative flow between key points
- Contains supplementary examples or background information
- Presents straightforward descriptive text
- Contains lists or enumerations of items
- Appears in appendices, references, or footnotes

## Implementation Instructions

The AI agent should:

1. **Preparation**:
   - Create an allocation plan for each chapter in JSON format (e.g., `chapter_XX/allocation.json`)
   - Structure the JSON file to map each paragraph to either "elevenlabs" or "espeak"
   ```json
   {
     "paragraph_001.md": "elevenlabs",
     "paragraph_002.md": "espeak",
     "paragraph_003.md": "elevenlabs"
   }
   ```

2. **Analysis**:
   - Analyze each paragraph based on the quality allocation guidelines
   - Estimate potential cost savings vs. quality impact for each decision
   - Document rationale for ElevenLabs selections

3. **Processing**:
   - Generate audio for ElevenLabs paragraphs first, using optimizations from `elevenlabs-audio-optimization.mdc`
   - Generate audio for Espeak paragraphs using standard settings
   - Store outputs in their respective directories:
     - ElevenLabs: `data/5-audio-chunks/`
     - Espeak: `data/5-audio-chunks-espeak/`

4. **Concatenation**:
   - Combine audio files from both sources according to the allocation plan
   - Ensure volume normalization between different audio sources
   - Output final chapter audio to `data/6-audio-chapters/`

5. **Documentation**:
   - Track cost savings achieved through hybrid approach
   - Document quality assessment of final output
   - Recommend adjustments to allocation strategy based on results

By following this hybrid strategy, the AI agent will balance quality and cost considerations while ensuring the most critical content receives the highest quality synthesis.
