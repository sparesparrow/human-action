# Audio Synthesis Master Rule

This master rule coordinates all audio generation strategies and optimizations for producing high-quality narration while managing costs effectively. It serves as the entry point for the AI agent to understand the complete audio generation workflow.

## Available Strategies

The project supports three main strategies for audio generation:

1. **Full ElevenLabs Generation** - Highest quality, highest cost
   - All content generated with ElevenLabs API
   - Uses optimizations from `elevenlabs-audio-optimization.mdc`
   - Suitable for critical content or small batches

2. **Hybrid Quality Strategy** - Balanced quality and cost
   - Critical content with ElevenLabs, standard content with Espeak
   - Follows allocation in `hybrid-quality-strategy.mdc`
   - Suitable for medium-sized batches with varying content importance

3. **Progressive Enhancement Strategy** - Initial coverage with gradual quality improvement
   - Initial generation with Espeak for all content
   - Selective upgrades to ElevenLabs over time
   - Follows approach in `progressive-enhancement-strategy.mdc`
   - Suitable for large batches or when rapid availability is prioritized

## Strategy Selection Guidelines

Select the appropriate strategy based on these factors:

- **Budget Constraints:** 
  - High budget → Full ElevenLabs
  - Medium budget → Hybrid Quality
  - Limited budget → Progressive Enhancement

- **Timeline Requirements:**
  - Immediate need → Espeak or Progressive Enhancement
  - Flexible timeline → Hybrid or Full ElevenLabs

- **Content Characteristics:**
  - Highly technical content → Full ElevenLabs or Hybrid
  - Standard narrative content → Progressive Enhancement acceptable

## Workflow Coordination

### 1. Planning Phase

- Use `prepare-next-chapter-for-audio-voice-synthesis.mdc` to identify pending chapters
- Select appropriate strategy based on above guidelines
- Create necessary allocation or upgrade plan documents

### 2. Preprocessing Phase

- Apply `elevenlabs-czech-preprocessing.mdc` for all content destined for ElevenLabs
- Implement general text optimizations for all content
- Create pronunciation dictionaries for recurring terms

### 3. Generation Phase

- For ElevenLabs content:
  - Apply all optimization techniques from `elevenlabs-audio-optimization.mdc`
  - Process in small batches to verify quality before full generation
  - Store in `data/5-audio-chunks/`

- For Espeak content:
  - Apply basic text cleaning and formatting
  - Process using established Espeak parameters
  - Store in `data/5-audio-chunks-espeak/`

### 4. Assembly Phase

- Concatenate audio following the appropriate strategy:
  - Full ElevenLabs: All from ElevenLabs directory
  - Hybrid: Mix from both directories according to allocation plan
  - Progressive: Initially all Espeak, later replacing selected segments

- Normalize volume across all sources
- Verify transitions between different audio sources

### 5. Documentation Phase

- Update progress tracking files:
  - `espeak_progress.json`
  - `elevenlabs_progress.json` (if applicable)
  - `upgrade_plan.json` (for Progressive strategy)
  
- Document costs, quality assessments, and improvement recommendations

## Implementation for AI Agent

The AI agent should:

1. Identify the most appropriate strategy based on batch size, content importance, and budget considerations
2. Follow the corresponding strategy-specific rule file
3. Implement all preprocessing steps from the Czech-specific rule
4. Apply ElevenLabs optimizations to all content using that API
5. Execute the generation workflow per the selected strategy
6. Document all decisions, allocations, and results

By integrating all these specialized rules, the AI agent will balance quality and cost concerns while ensuring optimal narration quality from ElevenLabs API on the first attempt.
