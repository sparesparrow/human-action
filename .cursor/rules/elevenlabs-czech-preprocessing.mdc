# ElevenLabs Czech Text Preprocessing Rule

This rule focuses on specific optimizations for Czech language narration using the ElevenLabs API to ensure high-quality results on first generation without requiring costly regeneration.

## Czech-Specific Preprocessing Guidelines

### 1. Diacritical Marks Verification

- Ensure all Czech-specific characters (á, č, ď, é, ě, í, ň, ó, ř, š, ť, ú, ů, ý, ž) are properly encoded
- Verify that no diacritical marks are missing, especially in technical terms
- Example: "ekonomie" should be "ekonomie" (if that's the correct form)

### 2. Proper Noun Pronunciation

For proper nouns, especially non-Czech names, add pronunciation guidance:

```
<!-- For foreign proper nouns -->
<alias name="Hayek">hajek</alias>
<alias name="von Mises">fon mízes</alias>
```

### 3. Economic and Technical Term Handling

For economic or technical terms that might be mispronounced:

```
<!-- For technical economic terms -->
<alias name="Grenznutzen">grenčnucn</alias>
<alias name="laissez-faire">lesé fér</alias>
```

### 4. Sentence Rhythm and Flow

Czech has specific rhythmic patterns that may need enhancement:

- Add natural breaks at clause boundaries, especially for long sentences
- Consider Czech-specific speech patterns and pacing
- Example: "Pokud měnová politika centrální banky <break time="0.3s" /> vede k inflaci, <break time="0.5s" /> pak následkem toho mohou být..."

### 5. Number and Date Formatting

Format numbers and dates for proper Czech pronunciation:

- Write numbers with spaces for thousands (e.g., "1 000" not "1000")
- Format years as full numbers ("1935" not "nineteen thirty-five")
- Format dates in Czech order: day-month-year

### 6. Quoted Text and Foreign Phrases

For quotes or foreign phrases:

- Indicate language context for proper pronunciation
- Consider adding phonetic guidance for non-Czech quotes
- Example: "Smith ve svém díle 'Wealth of Nations' <alias name="Wealth of Nations">velθ of nejšns</alias> uvádí..."

### 7. Common Mispronunciations to Address

Preemptively correct these common problems:

- "a vs. á" distinction in appropriate contexts
- "i vs. y" pronunciation in Czech words
- Proper stress patterns on first syllables
- "ř" pronunciation in difficult consonant clusters
- "ě" pronunciation after labial consonants

## Implementation for AI Agent

When preprocessing Czech text for ElevenLabs:

1. Scan text for all proper nouns and technical terms
2. Create a consistent pronunciation dictionary for recurring terms
3. Add appropriate break tags based on Czech sentence structure
4. Verify all diacritical marks are correctly applied
5. Apply pronunciation guidance for foreign or technical terminology
6. Test sample passages to verify natural Czech speech patterns

## Quality Verification Checklist

Before final submission to ElevenLabs API:

- [ ] All diacritical marks properly applied
- [ ] Proper nouns have pronunciation guidance
- [ ] Technical terms have consistent pronunciation
- [ ] Natural sentence breaks added
- [ ] Numbers and dates formatted for Czech pronunciation
- [ ] Foreign phrases have pronunciation guidance
- [ ] Sample test of complex passages performed

By following these Czech-specific preprocessing guidelines, the AI agent will produce significantly higher quality Czech narration with ElevenLabs on the first generation attempt.
