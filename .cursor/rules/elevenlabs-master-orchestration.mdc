## Integrated Workflow Implementation

The AI agent should implement this orchestrated workflow for each chapter:

### 1. Initial Analysis (Input: Raw Text)

```
for each chapter:
  1. Analyze paragraph complexity and importance
  2. Score content using Cost Optimization Analysis
  3. Create initial allocation plan
  4. Identify special handling requirements
```

### 2. Text Preparation (Input: Raw Text → Output: Optimized Text)

```
for each paragraph:
  1. Apply Content Structuring rules
  2. Apply Czech Preprocessing
  3. Apply Economic Terminology handling
  4. Apply Narrative Flow Optimization
  5. Document all transformations
```

### 3. Synthesis Planning (Input: Optimized Text → Output: Generation Plan)

```
for each chapter:
  1. Finalize engine allocation based on Cost Optimization
  2. Apply Hybrid Quality Strategy adjustments
  3. Document Progressive Enhancement path
  4. Generate pronunciation dictionaries
  5. Create detailed synthesis plan document
```

### 4. Audio Generation (Input: Generation Plan → Output: Raw Audio)

```
for each paragraph:
  1. Apply Audio Optimization techniques
  2. Generate audio with appropriate engine
  3. Store raw files with proper naming conventions
  4. Update generation registry
```

### 5. Audio Processing (Input: Raw Audio → Output: Enhanced Audio)

```
for each audio file:
  1. Apply appropriate post-processing workflow
  2. Add complete metadata
  3. Organize in standardized directory structure
  4. Perform quality validation
```

### 6. Chapter Compilation (Input: Enhanced Audio → Output: Chapter Audio)

```
for each chapter:
  1. Concatenate paragraph files with proper transitions
  2. Apply chapter-level normalization
  3. Add chapter metadata and markers
  4. Perform final quality check
```

## Decision-Making Framework

The AI agent should use this framework for handling edge cases and making decisions:

### 1. Content Categorization Matrix

| Content Type | Complexity | Importance | Recommended Approach |
|--------------|------------|------------|----------------------|
| Core theory | High | High | ElevenLabs with full optimization |
| Examples | Medium | Medium | Hybrid approach with emphasis on clarity |
| Historical context | Medium | Medium | Hybrid with focus on name pronunciation |
| Technical details | High | Medium | ElevenLabs for terminology-heavy sections |
| Narrative sections | Low | Low | Espeak with enhanced post-processing |

### 2. Quality-Cost Tradeoff Guidelines

When making allocation decisions, prioritize in this order:

1. **Chapter beginnings and endings**: Always high quality
2. **Key theoretical sections**: Always high quality
3. **Sections with complex terminology**: Prefer high quality
4. **Transition paragraphs**: Match quality of surrounding content
5. **Extended examples**: Can use cost-effective approach if clear
6. **Background information**: Lowest priority for premium quality

### 3. Quality Control Checkpoints

Implement these validation checkpoints in the workflow:

1. **Post-text optimization**: Verify readability and speech-friendliness
2. **Post-allocation**: Review engine assignments for coherence
3. **Sample generation**: Test representative paragraphs before full production
4. **Post-processing**: Verify audio quality and consistency
5. **Chapter compilation**: Ensure seamless transitions and consistent volume

## Documentation Requirements

The AI agent should maintain these documentation artifacts:

### 1. Chapter Production Record

For each chapter, create a structured record:

```json
{
  "chapter_id": "42",
  "title": "Human Cooperation",
  "processing_status": "completed",
  "processing_date": "2023-08-15",
  "paragraph_count": 65,
  "elevenlabs_paragraphs": 20,
  "espeak_paragraphs": 45,
  "total_duration": "1:15:32",
  "character_count": 45320,
  "estimated_cost": "$X.XX",

    {
      "paragraph_id": "013",
      "issue": "Complex terminology",
      "solution": "Applied custom pronunciation dictionary"
    }
  ],
  "quality_metrics": {
    "overall_rating": 4.5,
    "consistency": 4.7,
    "pronunciation": 4.3,
    "flow": 4.6
  }
}
```
