# Chapter Audio Synthesis Planning Rule

The objective of this rule is to prepare for future audio voice synthesis by creating a comprehensive plan. It should:

1. Scan available markdown files in `data/7-paragraphs/text/` to identify chapters pending audio processing.
2. Compare with existing audio chapters in `data/6-audio-chapters/` to avoid redundant work.
3. Draft a plan that specifies which sections will be included in the next release.
4. Save this plan in a dedicated markdown file (e.g., "next-chapter-audio-plan.md") with clear metadata and instructions.
5. Ensure the documentation facilitates smooth integration with the ElevenLabs API.

## Instructions for AI Agent

When applying this rule:

1. Generate a list of chapter directories in `data/7-paragraphs/text/` that don't have corresponding audio files in `data/6-audio-chapters/`.
2. Create or update the `next-chapter-audio-plan.md` file with:
   - Current date timestamp
   - Clear objective statement
   - Numbered list of chapters for processing
   - Detailed processing instructions
3. For each chapter, verify that paragraph files within the chapter directory are properly formatted and ready for processing.
4. Include a "Processing Instructions" section with specific steps for audio generation and verification.
5. Commit the updated plan to the repository before proceeding with audio generation.
